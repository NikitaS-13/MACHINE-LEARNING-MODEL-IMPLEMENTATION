#DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED: 
Objective: The goal of this task is to develop and implement a machine learning model using Python. This project will guide you through data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and making predictions. You'll gain hands-on experience with libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.

Instructions:

Data Preprocessing:

Load your dataset using pandas.

Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing the data if necessary.

Model Selection:

Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm based on your problem (e.g., classification, regression).

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Model Training:

Train the selected model using the training data.

Tune hyperparameters if needed to optimize the model.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE).

Analyze the results to ensure the model's performance meets the requirements.

Making Predictions:

Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

Save the model for future use
